title: "checking browser requirements"
---

We've noticed that the the website, and more importantly the game, doesn't
work for many of our users. The reason is that their web browser doesn't
support the necessary features. We heavily rely on features which have been
only recently implemented in Chrome and Firefox.

So we've added a page where you can go and it'll check if your browser
supports everything that is required. Just head over to the
[requirements][requirements] page and if everything is green then you should
be ok.
