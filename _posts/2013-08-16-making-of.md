title: "Making of.."
---

The last couple of months were rather quiet. One developer was away for a
month, and the other two were busy at work. In the past 2 weeks we rebooted
the regular hacking sessions. We focused our attention on fixing small issues
and added features that we missed while testing the new content.
At this time we do not want to relinquish too much information because we are
compiling a new video that contains an update to the product video we released
late last year.
We aim to finish and release the video on August 24th (roughly a week from
now) which coincides with the second birthday of encounter -- unbelivable we
really have been working on encounter for two full years (in our spare time)
now.

This tight timetable to finish the video lead us to meet on this and the
previous Friday evening in order to record, cut and script a new video. This
presented an excellent opportunity to hack the kitchen and test more (we did
the same thing while working on the first video) Modernist Cuisine recipes.

Long story short, last Friday we tried homemade basil pasta with sauce
Bolognese.

Producing a pasta dough with the correct consistency is painful (especially
the kneading). But it paid off: the pasta were exquisite. The Bolognese was
excellent as well, but shadowed the taste bouquet of the pasta too much.


Today we tried a self-made pizza dough (Neapolitan Pizza Dough) with Marinara
on a steel plate.

Without a pizza peel it was tricky (aka epic fail) to transfer the finished
(unbaked) pizza onto the steel plate. The result: pizza version 1.0 was not
very convincing (we hope we are better programmers than Pizzaioli). We learned
from our mistakes (debug session in front of the oven) and the second attempt
was much more enjoyable. In case you are wondering about the toppings:

* Mozarella
* Cherry tomato
* Arugula (add before serving)
* Smoked ham (add before serving)
* Mascarpone (add before serving)

which will henceforth be known as the rmx pizza.

We still accept suggestions for the menu next Friday..
