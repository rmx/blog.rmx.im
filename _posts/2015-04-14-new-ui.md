title: "New design and simplifications in the in-game user interface"
---

The in-game user interface felt outfashioned. In an effort to make the game
concepts and interactions clearer we simplified and redesigned the user
interface. After getting inspiration from various state-of-the art games (and
some fights with CSS) we came up with the following:

<span class="center">
  <span class="shadow">
![img](/assets/post/blog_new_ui.png)
  </span>
</span>

The main motivations behind the update are summarized below:

- the main part of the action takes place around the center of the screen: we
  moved the target's castbar just below the center and grouped the unit frames
  in two columns in the lower third of the screen.
- scale information indicators proportional to their importance: e.g. the
  resource (mana) indicator does not have to be as big as the health indicator
  and the targets castbar is central (to anticipate what your opponent is
  planning).
- minimizing the text: simplifying the combat log to show only short messages
  using spell icons and compacter objectives.
- colors to help recognizability: rehaul of the action bar using colored icons
  (including the key bindings).
