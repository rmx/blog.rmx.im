title: "Monthly Gamejam Sessions"
---
Good news everyone! Starting in October we will organize monthly (last
Tuesday in the month) game jams where you have the chance to test new
unreleased content with us.

These events will eventually look like:

* we meet at a specific time (e.g 4 pm EST) in a Google hangout, and announce
  the new content available for testing,
* /inv to join one of the battles with the goal to kill mean looking creatures,
* followed by a discussion about tuning and the design of the encounter,
* repeat last two steps,
* and finally you will be rewarded with a "gamejam" achievement.

So, if you want to help us make the new content challenging and interesting,
or simply enjoy to play the game together with the devs, make sure to mark
the 29.10.2013 in your calendar!

We will record game jams and some of the footage will be made available on
youtube or twitch.

Changes and reminders will be posted on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rmxinc).
