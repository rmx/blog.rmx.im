title: "Login via GitHub and Google"
---

Many people dislike websites which force them to create yet another account.
There are already enough websites for which you have to remember a password.
Since the start of our project, we have required users to create an account
with us. That has now changed: You can log in via GitHub or Google.

If you already have an account, you have to go to your [account
page](http://encounter.io/account) and link your encounter.io account with
your GitHub or Google accounts. Once that is done, you can use the GitHub and
Google button on the login page. If you don't have an account yet, just go to
the [login page](http://encounter.io/login) and click the GitHub or Google
button.

The login process is implemented using OAuth2. Sadly, Twitter doens't support
OAuth2, so you can not log in via Twitter. Facebook would certainly be
possible to support, but we just haven't got around writing the code. Drop us
an <a href='mailto:contact@encounter.io'>email</a> if you'd like to see
Facebook integrated as well.
