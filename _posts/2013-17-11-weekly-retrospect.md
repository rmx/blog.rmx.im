title: "Weekly Retrospect (Changelog)"
---

We have been quiet lately.. This does not mean that we abandoned or neglected
working on encounter in the last months. We started with a major rewrite of
the editor, using [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) technology. With
the a new version of the editor we hope to improve flexibility and
extensibility -- more on this topic once we are close to deploying the new
editor. Just let us note: so far it looks and feels awesome!

Aside from the editor we did a complete overhaul of the webpage, adopting a
more fashionable vertical style.


Aside from other small updates (for example new particle effect sources) we
finally acquired a first "professional" tile set from
[3DRT](http://3drt.com/store/environments/fantasy-environments/dungeon-master-kit.html)
resulting in a more consistent feel and look of the levels:

Motivated to reduce loading time of terrains with the new tiles we finally
adopted a texture cache.
Excited to put the new visual improvements to good use we started working on
new encounters (Onyxias little sister Sioxia) and continued tuning the
encounters in the pipeline. We are looking forward to the next game testing
session at the end of the month.
