title: "Improved navigation for ordinary users"
---

Until now we've concentrated mainly on the workflow from the point of view of
an encounter author. We've made it easy to create, edit and test encounters,
and tried to make this feedback loop as tight as possible. But due to that
the user experience for ordinary users suffered. Starting a game involved way
too many steps, we required users to explicitly sign up, they would come
across links to the editor part and so on. In short, we've never really tested
the onboarding experience or the workflow for ordinary users who just want to
play.

Over the last few days we've been fixing those issues. New users who come to
the homepage now should have a much more pleasant onboarding experience. The
dashboard shows a nicer overview of the available encounters, and upon
selecting one the user can jump right into the game. The only input which new
users have to provide is a name for their character. And they do not come
across any links which would lead them to the editor part. After they finish
a game, they continue navigating the public pages where they can view and
select other encounters.

But there still remains a lot of work to be done. The wardrobe for example is
in dire need of a redesign. We already have a few ideas and will be
implementing them over the course of the next few weeks.
