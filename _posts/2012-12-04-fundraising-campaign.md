After working on the game in our spare time for about a year, one of us quit
  his job to work on it full time.
So far we split the costs between the three of us.
Being able to work on the game full-time helped a lot, the project progressed
  much faster than during the previous months.
However, the money we invested is running out at the end of this year.

This is why we are launching a fundraising campaign to raise $30'000 by the
  end of the year.
Similar to Kickstarter project, we reward all donations above 5$.
Head over to the campaign page to see what those rewards are.
You also see what the money will be used for.

In addition we've created a product preview video which we hope will better
  explain what Encounter - The Game is.
It shows our motivation to create the game, and also features some previews of
  what's to come.
