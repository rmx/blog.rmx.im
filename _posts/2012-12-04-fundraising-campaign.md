We've worked on the game in our spare time for about a year. Then one of us
quit his job to work full time on it. We split the costs between us three.
Being able to work on it full-time helped a lot, the project progressed much
faster than during the previous months. However, the money we have available
is now running out.

This is why we have started fundraising campaign to raise $30'000 by the end
of the year. Much like on Kickstarter, when you donate certain amounts you get
some rewards in return. Head over to the campaign page to see what those
rewards are. You also see what the money will be used for.

We've also created a product preview video which we hope will better explain
what Encounter - The Game is. It shows our motivation to create the game, and
also features some previews of what's to come.
